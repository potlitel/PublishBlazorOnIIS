## ‚ú®About

JSON Schema is a declarative language for annotating and validating JSON documents' structure, constraints, and data types. It provides a way to standardize and define expectations for JSON data.

>[!NOTE]
   >
   >The JSON Schema team recommends using draft 7 or later. The current version is 2020-12! The previous version was 2019-09.

All the examples listed below have the same structure but for the sake of brevity, we will only be showing the code snippet corresponding to the validation segment:

```json

{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/product.schema.json",
  "title": "Your title",
  "description": "Your description",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": [ ... ],
  "properties": {
    "prop1": {
    },
    "prop2": {
    },
    "prop3": {
    },
    "propn": {
    }
  },
  "definitions": {
    "definition-1": {
    },
    "definition-2": {
    },
    "definition-n": {
    }
}

```

## üìÉTroubleshooting common hosting issues

### In this section, we will look into some of the common problems that you can face while hosting a Blazor application:

1- Once the prerequisites in step 2 have been installed, you must ensure that the following modules appear enabled in IIS:

  If these modules do not appear, proceed as follows:

  1.1- Open the windows command line with administrative privileges:

  1.2- Navigate to inetSrv location: 

  ```cmd
    cd C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv
  ```

  1.3- Run the following command to install the 'aspnetcore' module. You should get output similar to the following:
 
  ```cmd
    C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv>appcmd.exe install module /name:AspNetCoreModule /image:%windir%\system32\inetsrv\aspnetcore.dll
    GLOBAL MODULE object "AspNetCoreModule" added
    MODULE object "AspNetCoreModule" added
  ```

  1.4- Run the following command to install the 'aspnetcorev2' module. You should get output similar to the following:
 
  ```cmd
    C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv>appcmd.exe install module /name:AspNetCoreModuleV2 /image:"%ProgramFiles%\IIS\Asp.Net Core Module\V2\aspnetcorev2.dll"
    GLOBAL MODULE object "AspNetCoreModuleV2" added
    MODULE object "AspNetCoreModuleV2" added
  ```

  Once these steps have been completed, check again that the previously mentioned modules appear.
